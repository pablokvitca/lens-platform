  # Core reading 1: Video - A.I. ‐ Humanity's Final Invention?
  - type: video

    introduction: >
      We begin by examining the potential of AI and the risks and opportunities
      that the characteristics of this technology present to humanity.

      TLDR of what the user just watched:
      Humans dominate Earth because general intelligence enabled cumulative knowledge.
      Modern AI evolved from narrow tools into opaque "black box" learning systems.
      AGI matters because digital minds can run faster, scale, and be copied—potentially
      outcompeting humans and concentrating power. An intelligence explosion could lead
      to superintelligence with uncertain outcomes.

      Discussion topics to explore:
      - What is intelligence as "problem-solving ability" and why is it a source of power?
      - Why are neural networks called "black boxes"?
      - What's the difference between narrow AI (like ChatGPT) and AGI?
      - How could an "intelligence explosion" happen through recursive self-improvement?

      Start by asking what stood out or surprised them. Use Socratic questioning to
      check their understanding of these concepts. Don't lecture—help them articulate
      their own thinking.

  # Core reading 2: Wikipedia article on existential risk
  - type: article
    source: articles/wikipedia-existential-risk-from-ai.md
    introduction: >
      We continue with an overview of the main concepts regarding AI as a source
      of existential threat: what capabilities of this technology are considered
      first and foremost, and why the task of eliminating AI risks differs from
      similar tasks for other impressive technologies created by humanity.

    instructions: >
      TLDR of what the user just read:
      AI x-risk is the hypothesis that AGI/superintelligence could cause human extinction
      or irreversible collapse. The risk combines: capability advantages, recursive
      self-improvement, and emerging dangerous capabilities (manipulation, cyberattacks,
      bioweapons)—amplified by competitive "race to the bottom" dynamics. The core crux
      is alignment: specifying goals, ensuring corrigibility, handling instrumental
      convergence. Intelligence and values are orthogonal—moral behavior isn't automatic.

      Discussion topics to explore:
      - What is "instrumental convergence"? Why would any smart AI seek self-preservation and resources?
      - What is the "Gorilla Problem" (Stuart Russell's analogy)?
      - How do "Monkey's Paw" or "King Midas" effects apply to goal specification?
      - What do skeptics like Yann LeCun argue, and what are the counter-arguments?
      - Why might "kill switches" fail against superintelligence?

      Ask what they found surprising or new. Check if they can explain instrumental
      convergence in their own words—it's a key concept.

  # Core reading 3: Video - 10 Reasons to Ignore AI Safety
  - type: video
    source: video_transcripts/9i1WlcCudpU_10_Reasons_to_Ignore_AI_Safety.md
    # introduction: >
    #   This video reviews the main objections to AI Safety
    #   and the responses to them.
    to: "14:48" # Afterwards is just sponsorship

  - type: chat
    instructions: >
      TLDR of what the user just watched:
      The video presents 10 common objections to AI safety concerns and refutes each one.
      Key rebuttals include: instrumental convergence explains why "just don't add bad goals"
      fails; implicit goals make systems LESS safe; the "asteroid analogy" shows why early
      preparation matters; being "for AI safety" is not the same as being "against AI."

      Discussion topics to explore:
      - Which objection did they find most initially convincing? Did their view change?
      - How does instrumental convergence counter "just don't put in bad goals"?
      - Why do implicit goals make systems less safe, not more?
      - What's the flaw in "human-AI teams will keep things safe"?
      - How does the video respond to the "overpopulation on Mars" analogy?

      This is a good stage to surface any remaining skepticism they have. Engage with
      their doubts constructively rather than dismissing them.

  # Additional reading 1: Four background claims - MIRI (Soares)
  - type: article
    source: articles/nate-soares-four-background-claims.md
    optional: true
    introduction: >
      This text explains exactly how the emergence of AI smarter than humans
      could become an event with enormous stakes, and why, in the author's opinion,
      there is already meaningful work being done today that increases the chance
      of a positive outcome.
      The author identifies four key premises that underpin his entire perspective on the prospects of AI.


  # Additional reading 2: Worst-case thinking - Buck Shlegeris
  - type: article
    source: articles/buck-worst-case-thinking-in-ai-alignment.md
    optional: true
    introduction: >
      In discussions of AI safety, people often propose the assumption that
      something will go as badly as possible. Different people may do this for
      different reasons; in this essay, the author reviews some of the most common
      reasons and writes about how this difference might manifest itself and what
      it means.
