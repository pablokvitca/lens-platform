# Requirements: Mobile Responsiveness

**Defined:** 2026-01-21
**Core Value:** Students can consume course content on mobile — lessons, chatbot, videos all work on phone screens.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for mobile-responsive release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Foundation

- [x] **FOUND-01**: Remove MobileWarning blocker component so mobile users can access the app
- [x] **FOUND-02**: Configure dynamic viewport units (dvh) to handle iOS Safari address bar
- [x] **FOUND-03**: Set 16px minimum font size for mobile readability — *Outcome: Implemented at 18px for iOS zoom threshold compliance*
- [x] **FOUND-04**: Add safe area insets for notched devices (iPhone, etc.)

### Navigation

- [x] **NAV-01**: Header collapses to hamburger menu on mobile screens
- [x] **NAV-02**: All navigation links have 44px minimum touch targets
- [x] **NAV-03**: Header hides on scroll down, reappears on scroll up
- [x] **NAV-04**: Bottom navigation bar for primary actions on mobile

### Layout Components

- [x] **LAYOUT-01**: ModuleDrawer displays as full-screen overlay on mobile
- [x] **LAYOUT-02**: ModuleHeader stacks vertically on mobile with responsive widths
- [x] **LAYOUT-03**: CourseSidebar becomes slide-out drawer on mobile

### Content Components

- [x] **CONTENT-01**: ArticleEmbed uses responsive padding (less on mobile)
- [x] **CONTENT-02**: VideoEmbed scales to full width on mobile
- [x] **CONTENT-03**: VideoPlayer controls are touch-friendly (44px minimum)

### Chat Interface

- [x] **CHAT-01**: NarrativeChatSection uses responsive height (dvh units)
- [x] **CHAT-02**: Chat input stays visible when mobile keyboard opens
- [x] **CHAT-03**: Send and microphone buttons are 44px minimum touch targets
- ~~**CHAT-04**: Swipe gestures navigate through chat history~~ (Removed - user explicitly excluded from scope per CONTEXT.md)

### Progress & Stage Navigation

- [x] **PROG-01**: StageProgressBar dots and arrows are 44px touch targets
- [x] **PROG-02**: Module stage navigation works correctly on touch devices

### Motion & Transitions

- [x] **MOTION-01**: Drawers and overlays slide in/out with physical weight (300ms ease-out, slight overshoot)
- [x] **MOTION-02**: Page transitions feel connected — content slides rather than cuts
- [x] **MOTION-03**: Interactive elements respond to touch with immediate feedback (scale/opacity on press)
- [x] **MOTION-04**: Staggered reveals when loading content lists (chat messages, module stages)

### Typography & Reading

- [x] **TYPE-01**: Body text optimized for mobile reading — 18px base, 1.6 line height, comfortable measure
- [x] **TYPE-02**: Heading hierarchy scales appropriately on mobile (not just smaller desktop)
- [x] **TYPE-03**: Chat messages have distinct, readable typography with proper bubble spacing

### Visual Consistency

- [x] **VISUAL-01**: Mobile layouts maintain desktop's visual language — same colors, spacing rhythm, component shapes
- [x] **VISUAL-02**: Consistent touch feedback patterns across all interactive elements
- [x] **VISUAL-03**: Loading states match desktop aesthetic (skeleton screens, spinners)

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Native-Feel Enhancements

- **NATIVE-01**: Pull-to-refresh on content pages
- **NATIVE-02**: Haptic feedback on key interactions — *Note: Partially implemented in v1 for Android devices*
- **NATIVE-03**: Offline content caching for lessons
- **NATIVE-04**: Add to home screen (PWA) support

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Native mobile app | Web-first approach; mobile browser is sufficient for v1 |
| Facilitator dashboard on mobile | Admin tasks stay desktop-focused per PROJECT.md |
| Offline support | Requires significant architecture changes |
| Push notifications | Would require native capabilities |
| Tablet-specific layouts | Will work but not optimized; phones are priority |
