- Use Tailwind v4 built-in h-dvh/min-h-dvh utilities (no custom CSS needed)
- dvh units for all full-height containers for iOS Safari compatibility
- 100px threshold for scroll direction to prevent flickering (02-01)
- Menu slides from right for natural mobile gesture flow (02-01)
- z-50 for header, z-60 for menu overlay stacking (02-01)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

**From Research:**
- iOS 26 fixed position bug requires real device testing (Phase 5)
- visualViewport API has known iOS bugs — Phase 4 may need fallback strategies
- Chat interface (Phase 4) is most complex; phase-specific research recommended before planning
