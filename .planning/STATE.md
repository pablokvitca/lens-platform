## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- 18px body text exceeds iOS 16px zoom threshold
- Mobile-first typography scale with non-proportional desktop step-up
- Safe area CSS variables defined in globals.css, consumed in Phase 2
- Use Tailwind v4 built-in h-dvh/min-h-dvh utilities (no custom CSS needed)
- dvh units for all full-height containers for iOS Safari compatibility

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

**From Research:**
- iOS 26 fixed position bug requires real device testing (Phase 5)
- visualViewport API has known iOS bugs — Phase 4 may need fallback strategies
- Chat interface (Phase 4) is most complex; phase-specific research recommended before planning
