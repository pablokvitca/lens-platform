# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-14)

**Core value:** Students can engage with course content and demonstrate understanding — through reading, discussion, and assessment — while the platform collects data to improve both teaching and measurement.
**Current focus:** v2.0 Tests & Answer Boxes — Phase 8 Plan 01 complete, Plan 02 next

## Current Position

Phase: 8 of 9 (Test Sections) — IN PROGRESS
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: In Progress
Last activity: 2026-02-16 — Completed 08-01 (Test Section UI)

Progress: [===================......] 79% (19/24 plans across all milestones)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 18 (13 v1.0 + 5 v2.0)
- Average duration: ~45 min (v1.0 estimate)
- Total execution time: ~10 hours (v1.0) + 19 min (v2.0)

**By Phase (v1.0):**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Foundation | 2 | - | - |
| 2. Layout | 3 | - | - |
| 3. Content | 2 | - | - |
| 4. Chat | 2 | - | - |
| 5. Polish | 4 | - | - |

*v1.0 metrics not tracked in detail; tracking starts fresh for v2.0*

**By Phase (v2.0):**

| Phase | Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|-------|------|----------|-------|-------|
| 6. Data Foundation | 01 | 3 min | 2 | 4 |
| 6. Data Foundation | 02 | 5 min | 2 | 10 |
| 7. Answer Box | 01 | 11 min | 3 | 12 |
| 7. Answer Box | 02 | manual | 3 | 5 |
| 8. Test Sections | 01 | 9 min | 3 | 11 |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.0 decisions archived in:
- `.planning/milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md`
- `.planning/PROJECT.md` Key Decisions table

v2.0 decisions:
- Free-text only (no MC) for richer AI assessment signal
- Scores hidden from users until scoring accuracy improves
- Tests at end of module for time-gap measurement
- JSONB for assessment scores (schema flexibility)
- JSONB for answer_metadata (voice_used, time_taken_s, etc.)
- Separate assessment_scores table from responses (scores async in Phase 9)
- No unique constraint on (user, question) -- multiple attempts as separate records
- claim pattern for assessment responses follows existing progress claim pattern
- question segment allowed in all section types (page, lens-article, lens-video)
- parseSegments/convertSegment exported from lens.ts for reuse by test section parser
- test sections with no source create ParsedTestRef with empty segments array (not undefined)
- Position-based questionId (moduleSlug:sectionIndex:segmentIndex) for stable answer linking
- completed_at as nullable TIMESTAMP to distinguish finished from in-progress answers
- 2.5s default debounce for auto-save
- Ownership-checked PATCH with OR condition (user_id OR anonymous_token)
- FIELD_PATTERN regex must use [\w-]+ to support hyphenated field names
- Voice recording requires secure context guard (isSecureContext check before getUserMedia)
- AnswerBox gets optional onComplete callback for parent notification (used by TestSection)
- Test stage type uses type assertion in progress bar (Stage union doesn't include 'test')
- isActive is false when testState === 'completed' so all questions show collapsed
