### Article: Recursion, Magic
source:: [[../articles/recursion-magic]] 

#### Text
content::
Getting to plug the outputs of a process back into the input does not necessarily lead to an explosion though. Consider the case of EURISKO:

#### Article-excerpt
from:: "We have historical records aplenty"
to:: "recursive enough."

#### Text
content::
If the leftover grain only produced exactly the same amount of leftover grain on the next harvest, the agricultural revolution never would have happened. In order for positive feedback to occur, the new input needs to improve the output.
#### Chat: A more recursive mouse
instructions::
TLDR of what the user just read:
An article that explains EURISKO, an optimising compiler, and examines why such a program, if plugged into itself recursively does not generate an infinite degree of program optimisation. The answers given are that the input-output behaviour is left unchanged. An optimised EURISKO might optimize a program faster than its predecessor, but it still outputs the same thing.  

topics to explore:
- What would the optimisation have to be pointed at to cause an intelligence explosion?
- Where do speed and competence start to diverge?
- How can the notion of fizzling or fooming be linked back to the metaphor of neutron multiplication?
- What does a sufficiently recursive computer mouse look like? Is there such a thing? 

This is a good stage to consider whether intelligence/competence is a collection of separate skills or a single variable which can easily serve as its own input.
