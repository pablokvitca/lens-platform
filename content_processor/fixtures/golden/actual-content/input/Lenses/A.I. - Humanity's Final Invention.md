TLDR of what the user just watched:
Humans dominate Earth because general intelligence enabled cumulative knowledge. Modern AI evolved from narrow tools into opaque "black box" learning systems. AGI matters because digital minds can run faster, scale, and be copied—potentially outcompeting humans and concentrating power. An intelligence explosion could lead to superintelligence with uncertain outcomes.

Discussion topics to explore:
- What is intelligence as "problem-solving ability" and why is it a source of power?
- Why are neural networks called "black boxes"?
- What's the difference between narrow AI (like ChatGPT) and AGI?
- How could an "intelligence explosion" happen through recursive self-improvement?

Use Socratic questioning to check their understanding of these concepts. Don't lecture—help them articulate their own thinking.
