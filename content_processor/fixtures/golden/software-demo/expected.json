In order to design an ultraintelligent machine we need to understand more about the human brain or human thought or both. In the following pages an attempt is made to take more of the magic out of the brain by means of a \"subassembly\" theory, which is a modification of Hebb’s famous speculative cell-assembly theory. My belief is that the first ultraintelligent machine is most likely to incorporate vast artificial neural circuitry, and that its behavior will be partly explicable in terms of the subassembly theory. Later machines will all be designed by ultraintelligent machines, and who am I to guess what principles they will devise? But probably Man will construct the deus ex machina in his own image."

Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultra- intelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an \"intelligence explosion,\" and the intelligence of man would be left far behind (see for example refs. [22], [34], [44]). Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control. It is curious that this point is made so seldom outside of science fiction. It is sometimes worthwhile to take science fiction seriously. In one science fiction story a machine refused to design a better one since it did not wish to be put out of a job. This would not be an insuperable difficulty, even if machines can be egotistical, since the machine could gradually improve itself out of all recognition, by acquiring new equipment. B. V. Bowden stated on British television (August 1962) that there is no point in building a machine with the intelligence of a man, since it is easier to construct human brains by the usual method. A similar point was made by a speaker during the meetings reported in a recent IEEE publication [1], but I do not know whether this point appeared in the published report. This shows that highly intelligent people can overlook the \"intelligence explosion.\" It is true that it would be uneconomical to build a machine capable only of ordinary intellectual attainments, but it seems fairly probable that if this could be done then, at double the cost, the machine could exhibit ultraintelligence. Since we are concerned with the economical construction of an ultra-intelligent machine, it is necessary to consider first what such a machine would be worth. Carter [11] estimated the value, to the world, of J. M. Keynes, as at least 100,000 million pounds sterling. By definition, an ultraintelligent machine is worth far more, although the sign is uncertain, but since it will give the human race a good chance of surviving indefinitely, it might not be extravagant to put the value at a megakeynes."

Human brains are effectively discontinuous with chimpanzee brains due to a whole bag of design improvements, even though they and we share 95% genetic material and only a few million years have elapsed since the branch. Why this whole series of improvements in us, relative to chimpanzees? Why haven't some of the same improvements occurred in other primates?\n\nWell, this is not a question on which one may speak with authority ([so far as I know](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/kj/no_one_knows_what_science_doesnt_know)). But I would venture an unoriginal guess that, in the hominid line, one thing led to another.\n\nThe chimp-level task of modeling others, in the hominid line, led to improved self-modeling which supported recursion which enabled language which birthed politics that increased the selection pressure for outwitting which led to sexual selection on wittiness...\n\n...or something. It's hard to tell by looking at the fossil record what happened in what order and why. The point being that it wasn't _one optimization_ that pushed humans ahead of chimps, but rather a _cascade_ of optimizations that, in _Pan_, never got started.\n\nWe fell up the stairs, you might say. It's not that the first stair ends the world, but if you fall up one stair, you're more likely to fall up the second, the third, the fourth...\n\nI will concede that farming was a watershed invention in the history of the human species, though it intrigues me for a different reason than Robin. Robin, presumably, is interested because the economy grew by two orders of magnitude, or something like that. But did having a hundred times as many humans, lead to a hundred times as much thought-optimization _accumulating_ per unit time? It doesn't seem likely, especially in the age before writing and telephones. But farming, because of its sedentary and repeatable nature, led to repeatable trade, which led to debt records. Aha! - now we have _writing._ _There's_ a significant invention, from the perspective of cumulative optimization by brains. Farming isn't writing but it _cascaded to_ writing.\n\nFarming also cascaded (by way of surpluses and cities) to support _professional specialization_. I suspect that having someone spend their whole life thinking about topic X instead of a hundred farmers occasionally pondering it, is a more significant jump in cumulative optimization than the gap between a hundred farmers and one hunter-gatherer pondering something.\n\nFarming is not the same trick as professional specialization or writing, but it _cascaded_ to professional specialization and writing, and so the pace of human history picked up enormously after agriculture. Thus I would interpret the story.\n\nFrom a zoomed-out perspective, cascades can lead to what look like discontinuities in the historical record, _even given_ a steady optimization pressure in the background. It's not that natural selection _sped up_ during hominid evolution. But the search neighborhood contained a low-hanging fruit of high slope... that led to another fruit... which led to another fruit... and so, walking at a constant rate, we fell up the stairs. If you see what I'm saying.\n\n_Predicting_ what sort of things are likely to cascade, seems like a very difficult sort of problem.\n\nBut I will venture the observation that - with a sample size of one, and an optimization process very different from human thought - there was a cascade in the region of the transition from primate to human intelligence.\n\n## Cycles\n\nCycles happen when you connect the output pipe to the input pipe in a _repeatable_ transformation. You might think of them as a special case of cascades with very high regularity. (From which you'll note that in the cases above, I talked about cascades through _differing_ events: farming -> writing.)\n\nThe notion of cycles as a source of _discontinuity_ might seem counterintuitive, since it's so regular. But consider this important lesson of history:\n\nOnce upon a time, in a squash court beneath Stagg Field at the University of Chicago, physicists were building a shape like a giant doorknob out of alternate layers of graphite and uranium...\n\nThe key number for the \"pile\" is the effective neutron multiplication factor. When a uranium atom splits, it releases neutrons - some right away, some after delay while byproducts decay further. Some neutrons escape the pile, some neutrons strike another uranium atom and cause an additional fission. The effective neutron multiplication factor, denoted _k_, is the average number of neutrons from a single fissioning uranium atom that cause another fission. At _k_ less than 1, the pile is \"subcritical\". At _k_>= 1, the pile is \"critical\". Fermi calculates that the pile will reach _k_=1 between layers 56 and 57.\n\nOn December 2nd in 1942, with layer 57 completed, Fermi orders the final experiment to begin. All but one of the control rods (strips of wood covered with neutron-absorbing cadmium foil) are withdrawn. At 10:37am, Fermi orders the final control rod withdrawn about half-way out. The geiger counters click faster, and a graph pen moves upward. \"This is not it,\" says Fermi, \"the trace will go to this point and level off,\" indicating a spot on the graph. In a few minutes the graph pen comes to the indicated point, and does not go above it. Seven minutes later, Fermi orders the rod pulled out another foot. Again the radiation rises, then levels off. The rod is pulled out another six inches, then another, then another.\n\nAt 11:30, the slow rise of the graph pen is punctuated by an enormous CRASH - an emergency control rod, triggered by an ionization chamber, activates and shuts down the pile, which is still short of criticality.\n\nFermi orders the team to break for lunch.\n\nAt 2pm the team reconvenes, withdraws and locks the emergency control rod, and moves the control rod to its last setting. Fermi makes some measurements and calculations, then again begins the process of withdrawing the rod in slow increments. At 3:25pm, Fermi orders the rod withdrawn another twelve inches. \"This is going to do it,\" Fermi says. \"Now it will become self-sustaining. The trace will climb and continue to climb. It will not level off.\"\n\nHerbert Anderson recounted (as told in Rhodes's _The Making of the Atomic Bomb_):\n\n> \"At first you could hear the sound of the neutron counter, clickety-clack, clickety-clack. Then the clicks came more and more rapidly, and after a while they began to merge into a roar; the counter couldn't follow anymore. That was the moment to switch to the chart recorder. But when the switch was made, everyone watched in the sudden silence the mounting deflection of the recorder's pen. It was an awesome silence. Everyone realized the significance of that switch; we were in the high intensity regime and the counters were unable to cope with the situation anymore. Again and again, the scale of the recorder had to be changed to accomodate the neutron intensity which was increasing more and more rapidly. Suddenly Fermi raised his hand. 'The pile has gone critical,' he announced. No one present had any doubt about it.\"\n\nFermi kept the pile running for twenty-eight minutes, with the neutron intensity doubling every two minutes.\n\nThat first critical reaction had _k_ of 1.0006.\n\nIt might seem that a cycle, with the same thing happening over and over again, ought to exhibit continuous behavior. In one sense it does. But if you pile on one more uranium brick, or pull out the control rod another twelve inches, there's one hell of a big difference between _k_ of 0.9994 and _k_ of 1.0006.\n\nIf, rather than being able to calculate, rather than foreseeing and taking cautions, Fermi had just reasoned that 57 layers ought not to behave all that differently from 56 layers - well, it wouldn't have been a good year to be a student at the University of Chicago.\n\nThe inexact analogy to the domain of self-improving AI is left as an exercise for the reader, at least for now.\n\nEconomists like to measure cycles because they happen repeatedly. You take a potato and an hour of labor and make a potato clock which you sell for two potatoes; and you do this over and over and over again, so an economist can come by and watch how you do it.\n\nAs I [noted here at some length](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/vd/intelligence_in_economics), economists are much less likely to go around measuring how many scientific discoveries it takes to produce a _new_ scientific discovery. All the discoveries are individually dissimilar and it's hard to come up with a common currency for them. The analogous problem will prevent a self-improving AI from being _directly_ analogous to a uranium heap, with almost perfectly smooth exponential increase at a calculable rate. You can't apply the same software improvement to the same line of code over and over again, you've got to invent a new improvement each time. But if self-improvements are triggering more self-improvements with great _regularity,_ you might stand a long way back from the AI, blur your eyes a bit, and ask: _What is the AI's average neutron multiplication factor?_"

              "transcript": "Humans rule Earth without competition, but we're about to create something that may change that: our last invention, the most powerful tool, weapon, or maybe even entity - artificial superintelligence. This sounds like science fiction, so let's start at the beginning. Intelligence is the ability to learn, reason, acquire knowledge and skills, and use them to solve problems. Intelligence is power, and we're the species that exploited it the most. So much so that humanity broke the game of nature and took control. But the journey there wasn't straightforward. For most animals, intelligence costs too much energy to be worth it. Still, if we track intelligence in the tree of species over time, we can see lots of diverse forms of intelligence emerge. The earliest brains were in flatworms 500 million years ago - just a tiny cluster of neurons to handle basic body functions. It took hundreds of millions of years for species to diversify and become more complex. Life conquered new environments, gained new senses, and had to contend with fierce competition over resources. But in nature, all that matters is survival, and brains are expensive. So for almost all animals, a narrow intelligence fit for a narrow range of tasks was enough. In some environments, animals like birds, octopuses, and mammals evolved more complex neural structures. For them, it paid off to have more energy-consuming skills like advanced navigation and communication. Until 7 million years ago, the hominins emerged. We don't know why, but their brains grew faster than their relatives. Something was different about their intelligence. Very slowly, it turned from narrow to general - from a screwdriver to a multi-tool, able to think about diverse problems. 2 million years ago, Homo erectus saw the world differently from anyone before, as something to be understood and transformed. They controlled fire, invented tools, and created the first culture. We probably emerged from them around 250,000 years ago with an even larger and more complex brain. It enabled us to work together in large groups and to communicate complex thoughts. We used our intelligence to improve our lives, to ask how things work and why things are the way they are. With each discovery, we asked more questions and pushed forward, preserving what we learned, outpacing what evolution could do with genes. Knowledge builds on knowledge. Progress was slow at first and then sped up exponentially. Agriculture, writing, medicine, astronomy, or philosophy exploded into the world. 200 years ago, science took off and made us even better at learning about the world and speeding up progress. 35 years ago, the internet age began. Today, we live in a world made to suit our needs, created by us, for us. This is incredibly new. We forget how hard it was to get here, how enormous the steps on the intelligence ladder were, and how long it took to climb them. But once we did, we became the most powerful animal in the world in a heartbeat. But we may be in the process of changing this. We're building machines that could be better at the very thing that gave us the power to conquer the planet: humanity's final invention - artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence, or AI, is software that performs mental tasks with a computer code that uses silicon instead of neurons to solve problems. In the beginning, AI was very simple - lines of code on paper, mere proofs of concept to demonstrate how machines could perform mental tasks. Only in the 1960s did we start seeing the first examples of what we would recognize as AI: a chatbot in 1964, a program to sort through molecules in 1965 - slow, specialized systems requiring experts to use them. Their intelligence was extremely narrow, built for a single task inside a controlled environment. The equivalent of flatworms 500 million years ago, doing the minimum amount of mental work. Progress in AI research paused several times when researchers lost hope in the technology. But just like changing environments create new niches for life, the world around AI changed. Between 1950 and 2000, computers got a billion times faster while programming became easier and widespread. In 1972, AI could navigate a room. In 1989, it could read handwritten numbers. But it remained a fancy tool, no match for humans. Until in 1997, an AI shocked the world by beating the world champion in chess, proving that we could build machines that could surpass us. But we calmed ourselves because a chess bot"

But within this narrow task, it's so good that no human will ever again beat AI at chess. As computers continued to improve, AI became a powerful tool for more and more tasks. In 2004, it drove a robot on Mars. In 2011, it began recommending YouTube videos to you. But this was only possible because humans broke down problems into easy-to-digest chunks that computers could solve quickly - until we taught AIs to teach themselves. Rise of the Self-Learning Machines This is not a technical video, so we're massively oversimplifying here. In a nutshell, the sheer power of supercomputers was combined with the almost endless data collected in the information age to make a new generation of AI. AI experts began drastically improving forms of AI software called neural networks - enormously huge networks of artificial neurons that start out being bad at their tasks. They then used machine learning, which is an umbrella term for many different training techniques and environments that allows algorithms to write their own code and improve themselves. The scary thing is that we don't exactly know how they do it and what happens inside them - just that it works, and that what comes out the other end is a new type of AI, a capable black box of code. These new AIs could master complex skills extremely quickly, with much less human help. They were still narrow intelligences, but a huge step up. In 2014, Facebook AI could identify faces with 97% accuracy. In 2016, an AI beat the best humans in the incredibly complex game of Go. In 2018, a self-learning AI learned chess in 4 hours just by playing against itself, and then defeated the best specialized chess bot. Since then, machine learning has been applied to reading, image processing, solving tests, and much more. Many of these AIs are already better than humans for whatever narrow task they were trained. But they still remained a simple tool. AI still didn't seem that big of a deal for most people. And then came the chatbot ChatGPT. The work that went into it is massive. It trained on nearly everything written on the internet to learn how to handle language, which it now does better than most people. It can summarize, translate, and help with some math problems. It's incredibly more broad than any other system just a few years ago - not crushing any single benchmark, but a of them at once. Many large tech companies are spending billions to build powerful competitors. AI is already transforming customer service, banking, healthcare, marketing, copywriting, creative spaces, and more. AI-generated content has already taken hold of social media, YouTube, and news websites. Elections are expected to be inundated by propaganda and misinformation. No one is sure how much good or harm can come from adopting AI everywhere. Change is scary. There will be winners and losers. One of the biggest questions governments and corporations have now is how to manage the transition to an AI-boosted economy. All these potential gains or risks are just the result of today's AI. ChatGPT's intelligence is a major step up, but it remains narrow. It can write a great essay in seconds. It doesn't understand what it's writing. But what if the AIs stopped being narrow? General AI What makes humans different from current AI is our general intelligence. Humans can technically absorb any piece of knowledge and start working on any problem. We're great at many very different skills and tasks - from playing chess to writing or solving science puzzles. Not equally, of course. Some of us are experts in some fields and beginners in others, but we can technically do all of them. In the past, AI was narrow and able to become good at one skill but was rather bad in all the others. Simply by building faster computers and pouring more money into AI training will get us new, more powerful generations of AI. But what is the next step for AI is to become a general intelligence like us - an AGI. If the AI improvement process continues as it has been, it's not unlikely that AGI could be better in most or even all skills that humans can do. We don't know how to build AGI, how it will work, or what it will be able to do. Since narrow AIs today are capable of mastering one mental task quickly, AGI might be able to do the same with all mental tasks. So even if it starts out stupid, an AGI might be able to become as smart and capable as a human. While this sounds like science fiction,"

              "content": "One of the earliest authors to express serious concern that highly advanced machines might pose existential risks to humanity was the novelist [Samuel Butler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Butler_(novelist) \"Samuel Butler (novelist)\"), who wrote in his 1863 essay _[Darwin among the Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin\\_among\\_the\\_Machines \"Darwin among the Machines\")_:<sup>[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-29)</sup>\n\n> The upshot is simply a question of time, but that the time will come when the machines will hold the real supremacy over the world and its inhabitants is what no person of a truly philosophic mind can for a moment question.\n\nIn 1951, foundational computer scientist [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing \"Alan Turing\") wrote the article \"Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory\", in which he proposed that artificial general intelligences would likely \"take control\" of the world as they became more intelligent than human beings:\n\n> Let us now assume, for the sake of argument, that [intelligent] machines are a genuine possibility, and look at the consequences of constructing them... There would be no question of the machines dying, and they would be able to converse with each other to sharpen their wits. At some stage therefore we should have to expect the machines to take control, in the way that is mentioned in [Samuel Butler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Butler_(novelist) \"Samuel Butler (novelist)\")'s _[Erewhon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erewhon \"Erewhon\")_.<sup>[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-oxfordjournals-30)</sup>\n\nIn 1965, [I. J. Good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I._J._Good \"I. J. Good\") originated the concept now known as an \"intelligence explosion\" and said the risks were underappreciated:<sup>[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-31)</sup>\n\n> Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an 'intelligence explosion', and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control. It is curious that this point is made so seldom outside of science fiction. It is sometimes worthwhile to take science fiction seriously.<sup>[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-32)</sup>\n\nScholars such as [Marvin Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky \"Marvin Minsky\")<sup>[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-33)</sup> and I.

Notably, [Geoffrey Hinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton \"Geoffrey Hinton\") said in 2023 that he recently changed his estimate from \"20 to 50 years before we have general purpose A.I.\" to \"20 years or less\".<sup>[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-51)</sup>\n\n### Superintelligence\n\n\n\nIn contrast with AGI, Bostrom defines a [superintelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence \"Superintelligence\") as \"any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest\", including scientific creativity, strategic planning, and social skills.<sup>[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-52)</sup><sup>[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-superintelligence-7)</sup> He argues that a superintelligence can outmaneuver humans anytime its goals conflict with humans'. It may choose to hide its true intent until humanity cannot stop it.<sup>[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-economist_review3-53)</sup><sup>[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-superintelligence-7)</sup> Bostrom writes that in order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence must be aligned with human values and morality, so that it is \"fundamentally on our side\".<sup>[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:11-54)</sup>\n\n[Stephen Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking \"Stephen Hawking\") argued that superintelligence is physically possible because \"there is no physical law precluding particles from being organised in ways that perform even more advanced computations than the arrangements of particles in human brains\".<sup>[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-hawking_editorial-38)</sup>\n\nWhen artificial superintelligence (ASI) may be achieved, if ever, is necessarily less certain than predictions for AGI. In 2023, [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI \"OpenAI\") leaders said that not only AGI, but superintelligence may be achieved in less than 10 years.<sup>[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-55)</sup>\n\n#### Comparison with humans\n\n\n\nBostrom argues that AI has many advantages over the [human brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain \"Human brain\"):<sup>[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-superintelligence-7)</sup>\n\n*Speed of computation: biological [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron \"Neuron\") operate at a maximum frequency of around 200 [Hz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz \"Hertz\"), compared to potentially multiple GHz for computers.*   Internal communication speed: [axons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axon \"Axon\") transmit signals at up to 120 m/s, while computers transmit signals at the [speed of electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_electricity \"Speed of electricity\"), or optically at the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light \"Speed of light\").\n*Scalability: human intelligence is limited by the size and structure of the brain, and by the efficiency of social communication, while AI may be able to scale by simply adding more hardware.*   Memory: notably [working memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory \"Working memory\"), because in humans it is limited to a few [chunks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology) \"Chunking (psychology)\") of information at a time.\n*Reliability: transistors are more reliable than biological neurons, enabling higher precision and requiring less redundancy.*   Duplicability: unlike human brains, AI software and models can be easily [copied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_copying \"File copying\").\n*Editability: the parameters and internal workings of an AI model can easily be modified, unlike the connections in a human brain.*   Memory sharing and learning: AIs may be able to learn from the experiences of other AIs in a manner more efficient than human learning.\n\n#### Intelligence explosion\n\n\n\nFurther information: [Recursive self-improvement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_self-improvement \"Recursive self-improvement\")\n\nAccording to Bostrom, an AI that has an expert-level facility at certain key software engineering tasks could become a superintelligence due to its capability to recursively improve its own algorithms, even if it is initially limited in other domains not directly relevant to engineering.<sup>[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-superintelligence-7)</sup><sup>[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-economist_review3-53)</sup> This suggests that an intelligence explosion may someday catch humanity unprepared.<sup>[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-superintelligence-7)</sup>\n\nThe economist [Robin Hanson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hanson \"Robin Hanson\") has said that, to launch an intelligence explosion, an AI must become vastly better at software innovation than the rest of the world combined, which he finds implausible.<sup>[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-56)</sup>\n\nIn a \"fast takeoff\" scenario, the transition from AGI to superintelligence could take days or months. In a \"slow takeoff\", it could take years or decades, leaving more time for society to prepare.<sup>[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-57)</sup>\n\n#### Alien mind\n\n\n\nSuperintelligences are sometimes called \"alien minds\", referring to the idea that their way of thinking and motivations could be vastly different from ours. This is generally considered as a source of risk, making it more difficult to anticipate what a superintelligence might do. It also suggests the possibility that a superintelligence may not particularly value humans by default.<sup>[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-58)</sup> To avoid [anthropomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism \"Anthropomorphism\"), superintelligence is sometimes viewed as a powerful optimizer that makes the best decisions to achieve its goals.<sup>[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-superintelligence-7)</sup>\n\nThe field of [mechanistic interpretability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanistic_interpretability \"Mechanistic interpretability\") aims to better understand the inner workings of AI models, potentially allowing us one day to detect signs of deception and misalignment.<sup>[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-59)</sup>\n\n#### Limitations\n\n\n\nIt has been argued that there are limitations to what intelligence can achieve. Notably, the [chaotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory \"Chaos theory\") nature or [time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity \"Computational complexity\") of some systems could fundamentally limit a superintelligence's ability to predict some aspects of the future, increasing its uncertainty.<sup>[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-60)</sup>\n\n### Dangerous capabilities\n\n\n\nAdvanced AI could generate enhanced pathogens or cyberattacks or manipulate people. These capabilities could be misused by humans,<sup>[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:03-61)</sup> or exploited by the AI itself if misaligned.<sup>[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-superintelligence-7)</sup> A full-blown superintelligence could find various ways to gain a decisive influence if it wanted to,<sup>[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-superintelligence-7)</sup> but these dangerous capabilities may become available earlier, in weaker and more specialized AI systems.<sup>[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:03-61)</sup>\n\n#### Social manipulation\n\n\n\nGeoffrey Hinton warned in 2023 that the ongoing profusion of AI-generated text, images, and videos will make it more difficult to distinguish truth from misinformation, and that authoritarian states could exploit this to manipulate elections.<sup>[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-62)</sup> Such large-scale, personalized manipulation capabilities can increase the existential risk of a worldwide \"irreversible totalitarian regime\". Malicious actors could also use them to fracture society and make it dysfunctional.<sup>[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:03-61)</sup>\n\n#### Cyberattacks\n\n\n\nAI-enabled [cyberattacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack \"Cyberattack\") are increasingly considered a present and critical threat. According to [NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO \"NATO\")'s technical director of cyberspace, \"The number of attacks is increasing exponentially\".<sup>[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-63)</sup> AI can also be used defensively, to preemptively find and fix vulnerabilities, and detect threats.<sup>[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-64)</sup>\n\nA NATO technical director has said that AI-driven tools can dramatically enhance cyberattack capabilities-boosting stealth, speed, and scale-and may destabilize international security if offensive uses outstrip defensive adaptations.<sup>[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:03-61)</sup>\n\nSpeculatively, such hacking capabilities could be used by an AI system to break out of its local environment, generate revenue, or acquire cloud computing resources.<sup>[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-65)</sup>\n\n#### Enhanced pathogens\n\n\n\nAs AI technology democratizes, it may become easier to engineer more contagious and lethal pathogens. This could enable people with limited skills in [synthetic biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_biology \"Synthetic biology\") to engage in [bioterrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioterrorism \"Bioterrorism\"). [Dual-use technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-use_technology \"Dual-use technology\") that is useful for medicine could be repurposed to create weapons.<sup>[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:03-61)</sup>\n\nFor example, in 2022, scientists modified an AI system originally intended for generating non-toxic, therapeutic molecules with the purpose of creating new drugs. The researchers adjusted the system so that toxicity is rewarded rather than penalized. This simple change enabled the AI system to create, in six hours, 40,000 candidate molecules for [chemical warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_warfare \"Chemical warfare\"), including known and novel molecules.<sup>[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:03-61)</sup><sup>[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-66)</sup>\n\n### AI arms race\n\n\n\nMain article: [Artificial intelligence arms race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_arms_race \"Artificial intelligence arms race\")\n\nCompanies, state actors, and other organizations competing to develop AI technologies could lead to a [race to the bottom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_to_the_bottom \"Race to the bottom\") of safety standards.<sup>[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-67)</sup> As rigorous safety procedures take time and resources, projects that proceed more carefully risk being out-competed by less scrupulous developers.<sup>[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-68)</sup><sup>[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:03-61)</sup>\n\nAI could be used to gain military advantages via [autonomous lethal weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethal_autonomous_weapon \"Lethal autonomous weapon\"), [cyberwarfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare \"Cyberwarfare\"), or [automated decision-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_decision-making \"Automated decision-making\").<sup>[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:03-61)</sup> As an example of autonomous lethal weapons, miniaturized drones could facilitate low-cost assassination of military or civilian targets, a scenario highlighted in the 2017 short film _[Slaughterbots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterbots \"Slaughterbots\")_.<sup>[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-69)</sup> AI could be used to gain an edge in decision-making by quickly analyzing large amounts of data and making decisions more quickly and effectively than humans. This could increase the speed and unpredictability of war, especially when accounting for automated retaliation systems.<sup>[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:03-61)</sup><sup>[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-70)</sup>\n\n## Types of existential risk\n\n\n\nMain article: [Existential risk studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_studies \"Existential risk studies\")\n\n[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/X-risk-chart-en-01a.svg/500px-X-risk-chart-en-01a.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:X-risk-chart-en-01a.svg)\n\nScope-severity grid from Bostrom's paper \"Existential Risk Prevention as Global Priority\"<sup>[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-priority-71)</sup>\n\nAn [existential risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk \"Existential risk\") is \"one that threatens the premature extinction of Earth-originating intelligent life or the permanent and drastic destruction of its potential for desirable future development\".<sup>[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-72)</sup>\n\nBesides extinction risk, there is the risk that the civilization gets permanently locked into a flawed future. One example is a \"value lock-in\": If humanity still has moral blind spots similar to slavery in the past, AI might irreversibly entrench it, preventing [moral progress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_progress \"Moral progress\"). AI could also be used to spread and preserve the set of values of whoever develops it.<sup>[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-73)</sup> AI could facilitate large-scale surveillance and indoctrination, which could be used to create a stable repressive worldwide totalitarian regime.<sup>[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:0-74)</sup>\n\n[Atoosa Kasirzadeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atoosa_Kasirzadeh&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Atoosa Kasirzadeh (page does not exist)\") proposes to classify existential risks from AI into two categories: decisive and accumulative. Decisive risks encompass the potential for abrupt and catastrophic events resulting from the emergence of superintelligent AI systems that exceed human intelligence, which could ultimately lead to human extinction. In contrast, accumulative risks emerge gradually through a series of interconnected disruptions that may gradually erode societal structures and resilience over time, ultimately leading to a critical failure or collapse.<sup>[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-75)</sup><sup>[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-76)</sup>\n\nIt is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient and to what degree. But if [sentient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience \"Sentience\") machines are mass created in the future, engaging in a civilizational path that indefinitely neglects their welfare could be an existential catastrophe.<sup>[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-77)</sup><sup>[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-78)</sup> This has notably been discussed in the context of [risks of astronomical suffering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_of_astronomical_suffering \"Risk of astronomical suffering\") (also called \"s-risks\").<sup>[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-79)</sup> Moreover, it may be possible to engineer digital minds that can feel much more happiness than humans with fewer resources, called \"super-beneficiaries\". Such an opportunity raises the question of how to share the world and which \"ethical and political framework\" would enable a mutually beneficial coexistence between biological and digital minds.<sup>[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-80)</sup>\n\nAI may also drastically improve humanity's future. [Toby Ord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toby_Ord \"Toby Ord\") considers the existential risk a reason for \"proceeding with due caution\", not for abandoning AI.<sup>[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:0-74)</sup>[Max More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_More \"Max More\") calls AI an \"existential opportunity\", highlighting the cost of not developing it.<sup>[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-81)</sup>\n\nAccording to Bostrom, superintelligence could help reduce the existential risk from other powerful technologies such as [molecular nanotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_nanotechnology \"Molecular nanotechnology\") or [synthetic biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_biology \"Synthetic biology\"). It is thus conceivable that developing superintelligence before other dangerous technologies would reduce the overall existential risk.<sup>[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-superintelligence-7)</sup>\n\n## AI alignment\n\n\nFurther information: [AI alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment \"AI alignment\")\n\nThe alignment problem is the research problem of how to reliably assign objectives, preferences or ethical principles to AIs.\n\n### Instrumental convergence\n\n\n\nFurther information: [Instrumental convergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence \"Instrumental convergence\")\n\nAn [\"instrumental\" goal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_and_intrinsic_value \"Instrumental and intrinsic value\") is a sub-goal that helps to achieve an agent's ultimate goal. \"Instrumental convergence\" refers to the fact that some sub-goals are useful for achieving virtually _any_ ultimate goal, such as acquiring resources or self-preservation.<sup>[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-omohundro-82)</sup> Bostrom argues that if an advanced AI's instrumental goals conflict with humanity's goals, the AI might harm humanity in order to acquire more resources or prevent itself from being shut down, but only as a way to achieve its ultimate goal.<sup>[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-superintelligence-7)</sup>[Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_J._Russell \"Stuart J. Russell\") argues that a sufficiently advanced machine \"will have self-preservation even if you don't program it in... if you say, 'Fetch the coffee', it can't fetch the coffee if it's dead. So if you give it any goal whatsoever, it has a reason to preserve its own existence to achieve that goal.\"<sup>[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-vanity-26)</sup><sup>[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Wakefield2015-83)</sup>\n\n### Difficulty of specifying goals\n\n\n\nIn the \"[intelligent agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent \"Intelligent agent\")\" model, an AI can loosely be viewed as a machine that chooses whatever action appears to best achieve its set of goals, or \"utility function\". A utility function gives each possible situation a score that indicates its desirability to the agent. Researchers know how to write utility functions that mean \"minimize the average network latency in this specific telecommunications model\" or \"maximize the number of reward clicks\", but do not know how to write a utility function for \"maximize [human flourishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia \"Eudaimonia\")\"; nor is it clear whether such a function meaningfully and unambiguously exists. Furthermore, a utility function that expresses some values but not others will tend to trample over the values the function does not reflect.<sup>[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-84)</sup><sup>[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-85)</sup>\n\nAn additional source of concern is that AI \"must reason about what people _intend_ rather than carrying out commands literally\", and that it must be able to fluidly solicit human guidance if it is too uncertain about what humans want.<sup>[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-acm2-86)</sup>\n\n### Corrigibility\n\n\n\nAssuming a goal has been successfully defined, a sufficiently advanced AI might resist subsequent attempts to change its goals. If the AI were superintelligent, it would likely succeed in out-maneuvering its human operators and prevent itself from being reprogrammed with a new goal.<sup>[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-superintelligence-7)</sup><sup>[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-87)</sup> This is particularly relevant to value lock-in scenarios. The field of \"corrigibility\" studies how to make agents that will not resist attempts to change their goals.<sup>[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:5-88)</sup> Nayebi<sup>[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-89)</sup> has produced the first complete formal solution to corrigibility in the off-switch game, including in multi-step and partially observed settings.\n\n### Alignment of superintelligences\n\n\n\nSome researchers believe the alignment problem may be particularly difficult when applied to superintelligences. Their reasoning includes:\n\n*As AI systems increase in capabilities, the potential dangers associated with experimentation grow. This makes iterative, empirical approaches increasingly risky.<sup>[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-superintelligence-7)</sup><sup>[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:3-90)</sup>*   If instrumental goal convergence occurs, it may only do so in sufficiently intelligent agents.<sup>[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-91)</sup>\n*A superintelligence may find unconventional and radical solutions to assigned goals. Bostrom gives the example that if the objective is to make humans smile, a weak AI may perform as intended, while a superintelligence may decide a better solution is to \"take control of the world and stick electrodes into the facial muscles of humans to cause constant, beaming grins.\"<sup>[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:11-54)</sup>*   A superintelligence in creation could gain some awareness of what it is, where it is in development (training, testing, deployment, etc.), and how it is being monitored, and use this information to deceive its handlers.<sup>[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-92)</sup> Bostrom writes that such an AI could feign alignment to prevent human interference until it achieves a \"decisive strategic advantage\" that allows it to take control.<sup>[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-superintelligence-7)</sup>\n*Analyzing the internals and interpreting the behavior of LLMs is difficult. And it could be even more difficult for larger and more intelligent models.<sup>[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:3-90)</sup>\n\nAlternatively, some find reason to believe superintelligences would be better able to understand morality, human values, and complex goals. Bostrom writes, \"A future superintelligence occupies an epistemically superior vantage point: its beliefs are (probably, on most topics) more likely than ours to be true\".<sup>[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-superintelligence-7)</sup>\n\nIn 2023, OpenAI started a project called \"Superalignment\" to solve the alignment of superintelligences in four years. It called this an especially important challenge, as it said superintelligence could be achieved within a decade. Its strategy involved automating alignment research using AI.<sup>[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-93)</sup> The Superalignment team was dissolved less than a year later.<sup>[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-94)</sup>\n\n### Difficulty of making a flawless design\n\n\n\n_[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial\\_Intelligence:\\_A\\_Modern\\_Approach \"Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach\")_, a widely used undergraduate AI textbook,<sup>[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-slate_killer-95)</sup><sup>[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-96)</sup> says that superintelligence \"might mean the end of the human race\".<sup>[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-aima-1)</sup> It states: \"Almost any technology has the potential to cause harm in the wrong hands, but with [superintelligence], we have the new problem that the wrong hands might belong to the technology itself.\"<sup>[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-aima-1)</sup> Even if the system designers have good intentions, two difficulties are common to both AI and non-AI computer systems:<sup>[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-aima-1)</sup>\n*   The system's implementation may contain initially unnoticed but subsequently catastrophic bugs.<sup>[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-skeptic-97)</sup>\n*No matter how much time is put into pre-deployment design, a system's specifications often result in [unintended behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unintended_consequences \"Unintended consequences\") the first time it encounters a new scenario.<sup>[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-vanity-26)</sup>\n\nAI systems uniquely add a third problem: that even given \"correct\" requirements, bug-free implementation, and initial good behavior, an AI system's dynamic learning capabilities may cause it to develop unintended behavior, even without unanticipated external scenarios. For a self-improving AI to be completely safe, it would need not only to be bug-free, but to be able to design successor systems that are also bug-free.<sup>[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-aima-1)</sup><sup>[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-98)</sup>\n\n### Orthogonality thesis\n\n\n\nSome skeptics, such as Timothy B. Lee of _[Vox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox\\_(website) \"Vox (website)\")_, argue that any superintelligent program we create will be subservient to us, that the superintelligence will (as it grows more intelligent and learns more facts about the world) spontaneously learn moral truth compatible with our values and adjust its goals accordingly, or that we are either intrinsically or convergently valuable from the perspective of an artificial intelligence.<sup>[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-99)</sup>\n\nBostrom's \"orthogonality thesis\" argues instead that almost any level of intelligence can be combined with almost any goal.<sup>[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-100)</sup> Bostrom warns against [anthropomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism \"Anthropomorphism\"): a human will set out to accomplish their projects in a manner that they consider reasonable, while an artificial intelligence may hold no regard for its existence or for the welfare of humans around it, instead caring only about completing the task.<sup>[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-101)</sup>\n\nStuart Armstrong argues that the orthogonality thesis follows logically from the philosophical \"[is-ought distinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is-ought_distinction \"Is-ought distinction\")\" argument against [moral realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_realism \"Moral realism\"). He notes that any fundamentally friendly AI could be made unfriendly with modifications as simple as negating its utility function.<sup>[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-armstrong-102)</sup>\n\nSkeptic [Michael Chorost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Chorost \"Michael Chorost\") rejects Bostrom's orthogonality thesis, arguing that \"by the time [the AI] is in a position to imagine tiling the Earth with solar panels, it'll know that it would be morally wrong to do so.\"<sup>[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-chorost-103)</sup>\n\n### Anthropomorphic arguments\n\n\n\n[Anthropomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism \"Anthropomorphism\") arguments assume that, as machines become more intelligent, they will begin to display many human traits, such as morality or a thirst for power. Although anthropomorphic scenarios are common in fiction, most scholars writing about the existential risk of artificial intelligence reject them.<sup>[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-yudkowsky-global-risk-24)</sup> Instead, advanced AI systems are typically modeled as [intelligent agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent \"Intelligent agent\").\n\nThe academic debate is between those who worry that AI might threaten humanity and those who believe it would not. Both sides of this debate have framed the other side's arguments as illogical anthropomorphism.<sup>[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-yudkowsky-global-risk-24)</sup> Those skeptical of AGI risk accuse their opponents of anthropomorphism for assuming that an AGI would naturally desire power; those concerned about AGI risk accuse skeptics of anthropomorphism for believing an AGI would naturally value or infer human ethical norms.<sup>[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-yudkowsky-global-risk-24)</sup><sup>[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Telegraph2016-104)</sup>\n\nEvolutionary psychologist [Steven Pinker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pinker \"Steven Pinker\"), a skeptic, argues that \"AI dystopias project a parochial alpha-male psychology onto the concept of intelligence. They assume that superhumanly intelligent robots would develop goals like deposing their masters or taking over the world\"; perhaps instead \"artificial intelligence will naturally develop along female lines: fully capable of solving problems, but with no desire to annihilate innocents or dominate the civilization.\"<sup>[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-shermer-105)</sup> Facebook's director of AI research, [Yann LeCun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yann_LeCun \"Yann LeCun\"), has said: \"Humans have all kinds of drives that make them do bad things to each other, like the self-preservation instinct...

              "content": "MIRI's mission is to ensure that the creation of smarter-than-human artificial intelligence has a positive impact. Why is this mission important, and why do we think that there's work we can do today to help ensure any such thing?\n\nIn this post and my next one, I'll try to answer those questions. This post will lay out what I see as the four most important premises underlying our mission. Related posts include Eliezer Yudkowsky's \"[Five Theses](http://intelligence.org/2013/05/05/five-theses-two-lemmas-and-a-couple-of-strategic-implications/)\" and Luke Muehlhauser's \"[Why MIRI?](https://intelligence.org/2014/04/20/why-miri/)\"; this is my attempt to make explicit the claims that are in the background whenever I assert that our mission is of critical importance.\n\n## Claim #1: Humans have a very general ability to solve problems and achieve goals across diverse domains.\n\nWe call this ability \"intelligence,\" or \"general intelligence.\" This isn't a [formal definition](https://intelligence.org/2013/06/19/what-is-intelligence-2/) - if we knew _exactly_ what general intelligence was, we'd be better able to program it into a computer - but we do think that there's a real phenomenon of general intelligence that we cannot yet replicate in code.\n\n**Alternative view:** There is no such thing as general intelligence. Instead, humans have a collection of disparate special-purpose modules. Computers will keep getting better at narrowly defined tasks such as chess or driving, but at no point will they acquire \"generality\" and become significantly more useful, because there is no generality to acquire. ([Robin Hanson](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2014/07/limits-on-generality.html) has argued for versions of this position.)\n\n**Short response:** I find the \"disparate modules\" hypothesis implausible in light of how readily humans can gain mastery in domains that are utterly foreign to our ancestors. That's not to say that general intelligence is some irreducible occult property; it presumably comprises a number of different cognitive faculties and the interactions between them. The whole, however, has the effect of making humans much more cognitively versatile and adaptable than (say) chimpanzees.\n\n**Why this claim matters:** Humans have achieved a dominant position over other species not by being stronger or more agile, but by being more intelligent. If some key part of this general intelligence was able to evolve in the few million years since our common ancestor with chimpanzees lived, this suggests there may exist a relatively short list of key insights that would allow human engineers to build powerful generally intelligent AI systems.\n\n**Further reading:** Salamon et al., \"[How Intelligible is Intelligence?](https://intelligence.org/files/HowIntelligible.pdf)\"\n\n## Claim #2: AI systems could become much more intelligent than humans.\n\nResearchers at MIRI tend to lack strong beliefs about _when_ smarter-than-human machine intelligence will be developed. We do, however, expect that (a) human-equivalent machine intelligence will eventually be developed (likely within a century, barring catastrophe); and (b) machines can become significantly more intelligent than any human.\n\n**Alternative view #1:** Brains do something special that cannot be replicated on a computer.\n\n**Short response:** Brains are physical systems, and if certain versions of the [Church-Turing thesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis) hold then computers can in principle replicate the functional input/output behavior of any physical system. Also, note that \"intelligence\" (as I'm using the term) is about problem-solving capabilities: even if there were some special human feature (such as [qualia](http://www.iep.utm.edu/hard-con/)) that computers couldn't replicate, this would be irrelevant unless it prevented us from designing problem-solving machines.\n\n**Alternative view #2:** The algorithms at the root of general intelligence are so complex and indecipherable that human beings will not be able to program any such thing for many centuries.\n\n**Short response:** This seems implausible in light of evolutionary evidence. The genus _Homo_ diverged from other genera only 2.8 million years ago, and the intervening time - a blink in the eye of natural selection - was sufficient for generating the cognitive advantages seen in humans. This strongly implies that whatever sets humans apart from less intelligent species is not extremely complicated: the building blocks of general intelligence must have been present in chimpanzees.\n\nIn fact, the relatively intelligent behavior of dolphins suggests that the building blocks were probably there even as far back as the mouse-sized common ancestor of humans and dolphins. One could argue that mouse-level intelligence will take many centuries to replicate, but this is a more difficult claim to swallow, given [rapid advances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYQrNfSmQ0M) in the field of AI. In light of evolutionary evidence and the last few decades of AI research, it looks to me like intelligence is something we will be able to comprehend and program into machines.\n\n**Alternative view #3:** Humans are already at or near peak physically possible intelligence. Thus, although we may be able to build human-equivalent intelligent machines, we won't be able to build superintelligent machines.\n\n**Short response:** It would be surprising if humans were perfectly designed reasoners, for the same reason it would be surprising if airplanes couldn't fly faster than birds. Simple physical calculations bear this intuition out: for example, it seems well possible, within the boundaries of physics, to run a computer simulation of a human brain at thousands of times the normal speed.\n\nSome expect that speed wouldn't matter, because the real bottleneck is waiting for data to come in from physical experiments. This seems unlikely to me. There are many interesting physical experiments that can be sped up, and I have a hard time believing that a team of humans running at a 1000x speedup would fail to outperform their normal-speed counterparts (not least because they could rapidly develop new tools and technology to assist them).\n\nI furthermore expect it's possible to build _better_ reasoners (rather than just _faster_ reasoners) that use computing resources more effectively than humans do, even running at the same speed.\n\n**Why this claim matters:** Human-designed machines often knock the socks off of biological creatures when it comes to performing tasks we care about: automobiles cannot heal or reproduce, but they sure can carry humans a lot farther and faster than a horse. If we can build intelligent machines specifically designed to solve the world's largest problems through scientific and technological innovation, then they could improve the world at an unprecedented pace. In other words, AI matters.\n\n**Further reading:** Chalmers, \"[The Singularity: A Philosophical Analysis](http://consc.net/papers/singularity.pdf)\"\n\n## Claim #3: If we create highly intelligent AI systems, their decisions will shape the future.\n\nHumans use their intelligence to create tools and plans and technology that allow them to shape their environments to their will (and fill them with refrigerators, and cars, and cities). We expect that systems which are even more intelligent would have even more ability to shape their surroundings, and thus, smarter-than-human AI systems could wind up with significantly more control over the future than humans have.\n\n**Alternative view:** An AI system would never be able to out-compete humanity as a whole, no matter how intelligent it became. Our environment is simply too competitive; machines would have to work with us and integrate into our economy.\n\n**Short response:** I have no doubt that an autonomous AI system attempting to accomplish simple tasks would initially have strong incentives to integrate with our economy: if you build an AI system that collects stamps for you, it will likely start by acquiring money to purchase stamps. But what if the system accrues a strong technological or strategic advantage?\n\nAs an extreme example, we can imagine the system developing nanomachines and using them to convert as much matter as it can into stamps; it wouldn't necessarily care whether that matter came from \"dirt\" or \"money\" or \"people.\" Selfish actors only have an incentive to participate in the economy when their gains from trade are greater than the net gains they would get by ignoring the economy and just taking the resources for their own.\n\nSo the question is whether it will be possible for an AI system to gain a decisive technological or strategic advantage. I see this as the most uncertain claim out of the ones I've listed here. However, I expect that the answer is still a clear \"yes.\"\n\nHistorically, conflicts between humans have often ended with the technologically superior group dominating its rival. At present, there are a number of technological and social innovations that seem possible but have not yet been developed. Humans coordinate slowly and poorly, compared to what distributed software systems could achieve. All of this suggests that if we build a machine that does science faster or better than we can, it could quickly gain a technological and/or strategic advantage over humanity for itself or for its operators. This is particularly true if its intellectual advantage allows it to socially manipulate humans, acquire new hardware (legally or otherwise), produce better hardware, create copies of itself, or improve its own software. For good or ill, much of the future is likely to be determined by superintelligent decision-making machines.\n\n**Why this claim matters:** Because the future matters. If we want things to be better in the future (or at least not get worse), then it is prudent to prioritize research into the processes that will have high leverage over the future.\n\n**Further reading:** Armstrong, _[Smarter Than Us](https://intelligence.org/smarter-than-us/)_\n\n## Claim #4: Highly intelligent AI systems won't be beneficial by default.\n\nWe'd like to see the smarter-than-human AI systems of the future working together with humanity to build a better future; but that won't happen by default. In order to build AI systems that have a beneficial impact, we have to solve a number of technical challenges over and above building more powerful and general AI systems.\n\n**Alternative view:** As humans have become smarter, we've also become more peaceful and tolerant. As AI becomes smarter, it will likewise be able to better figure out our values, and will better execute on them.\n\n**Short response:** Sufficiently intelligent artificial reasoners would be able to _figure out_ our intentions and preferences; but this [does not imply](http://lesswrong.com/lw/igf/the_genie_knows_but_doesnt_care/) that they would execute plans that are in accordance with them.\n\nA self-modifying AI system could inspect its code and decide whether to continue pursuing the goals it was given or whether it would rather change them. But how is the program deciding which modification to execute?\n\nThe AI system is a physical system, and somewhere inside it, it's constructing predictions about how the universe would look if it did various things. Some other part of the system is comparing those outcomes and then executing actions that lead towards outcomes that the current system ranks highly. If the agent is initially programmed to execute plans that lead towards a universe in which it predicts that cancer is cured, then it will only modify its goal if it predicts that this will lead to a cure for cancer.\n\nRegardless of their intelligence level, and regardless of your intentions, computers do _exactly_ what you programmed them to do. If you program an extremely intelligent machine to execute plans that it predicts lead to futures where cancer is cured, then it may be that the shortest path it can find to a cancer-free future entails kidnapping humans for experimentation (and resisting your attempts to alter it, as those would slow it down).\n\nThere isn't any spark of compassion that automatically imbues computers with respect for other sentients once they crosses a certain capability threshold. If you want compassion, you have to program it in.\n\n**Why this claim matters:** A lot of the world's largest problems would be much easier to solve with superintelligent assistance - but attaining those benefits requires that we do more than just improve the capabilities of AI systems. You only get a system that does what you intended if you know how to program it to take your intentions into account, and execute plans that fulfill them.\n\n**Further reading:** Bostrom, \"[The Superintelligent Will](http://www.nickbostrom.com/superintelligentwill.pdf)\"\n\nThese four claims form the core of the argument that artificial intelligence is important: there is such a thing as general reasoning ability; if we build general reasoners, they could be far smarter than humans; if they are far smarter than humans, they could have an immense impact; and that impact will not be beneficial by default.\n\nAt present, billions of dollars and thousands of person-years are pouring into AI _capabilities_ research, with comparatively little effort going into AI safety research. Artificial superintelligence may arise sometime in the next few decades, and will almost surely be created in one form or another over the next century or two, barring catastrophe. Superintelligent systems will either have an extremely positive impact on humanity, or an extremely negative one; it is up to us to decide which."
