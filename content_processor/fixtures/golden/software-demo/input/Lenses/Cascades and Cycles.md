### Article: Cascades, Cycles, Insight...

Cybernetics is the study of systems whose output is used as their input: Successful investment produces funds which can then be invested again. There are negative feedback systems which hold themselves in equilibrium and positive feedback systems which multiply their output at each step. Hold this idea in mind as you read the following article about types of feedback as they pertain to intelligence.

#### Article-excerpt

to:: "neutron multiplication factor?_"

What are the properties that make something a cycle rather than a cascade? Can you think of cycles that could form with regards to general intelligence?
#### Chat: Discussion on Cycles
instructions::
TLDR of what the user just read:
An article that explains positive feedback loops especially with regards to civilisational competence. It explains "cascades" as breakthroughs which probabilisticly  opens up other breakthroughs in related fields and "cycles" as processes which generate some excess quantity that can be reinvested into the same process. Examples provided are neutron multiplication in radioactive materials as a cycle  and the development of writing leading to various civilisational breakthroughs as a cascade. 

topics to explore:
- Does it seem like intelligence has some universal equivalent that can be directly reinvested?
- What is AI's neutron multiplication factor?
- What are the properties that make something a cycle?
- How do cycles and cascades cause discontinuity in an otherwise gradual growth?
- How applicable do these concepts seem to artificial intelligence?

This is a good stage to raise worry about the ability to predict a system's abilities at time t+1 based on its abilities at time t.
